== Module (chicken repl)

This module provides procedures you can use to create your own
Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL).

=== repl

<procedure>(repl [EVALUATOR])</procedure>

Start a new read-eval-print loop. Sets the {{reset-handler}} so that
any invocation of {{reset}} restarts the read-eval-print loop. Also
changes the current exception-handler to display a message, write
any arguments to the value of {{(current-error-port)}} and reset.

If {{EVALUATOR}} is given, it should be a procedure of one argument that
is used in place of {{eval}} to evaluate each entered expression.

You can use {{quit}} to terminate the current read-eval-print loop.
Encountering end-of-file also terminates the current REPL.


=== repl-prompt

<parameter>(repl-prompt)</parameter>

A procedure that should evaluate to a string that will be printed before
reading interactive input from the user in a read-eval-print loop.
Defaults to {{(lambda () "#;N> ")}}.


=== quit

<procedure>(quit [RESULT])</procedure>

In the interpreter {{quit}} exits the currently active read-eval-print
loop.  In compiled code, it is equivalent to calling {{exit}}. See
also the {{repl}} procedure.


=== reset

<procedure>(reset)</procedure>

Reset program (Invokes {{reset-handler}}).


=== reset-handler

<parameter>(reset-handler)</parameter>

A procedure of zero arguments that is called via {{reset}}. The
default behavior in compiled code is to invoke the value of
{{(exit-handler)}}. The default behavior in the interpreter is to
abort the current computation and to restart the read-eval-print loop.
