== Module (chicken time)

This module provides a few basic procedures for measuring time.
For representation and manipulation of calendar time, see
[[Module (chicken time posix)]].

=== Retrieving timestamp information

==== cpu-time

<procedure>(cpu-time)</procedure>

Returns the used CPU time of the current process in milliseconds as
two values: the time spent in user code, and the time spent in system
code. On platforms where user and system time can not be differentiated,
system time will be always be 0.


==== current-process-milliseconds

<procedure>(current-process-milliseconds)</procedure>

Returns the number of milliseconds since process startup.


==== current-seconds

<procedure>(current-seconds)</procedure>

Returns the number of seconds since midnight, Jan. 1, 1970.


=== Benchmarking macros

==== time

<macro>(time EXP1 ...)</macro>

Performs a major garbage collection, evaluates {{EXP1 ...}} and prints
elapsed CPU time and some values about GC use, like time spent in
major GCs, number of minor and major GCs. The output is sent to the
port that is the current value of {{(current-error-port)}}. Nested
invocations of this form will give incorrect results for all output
but the innermost.
