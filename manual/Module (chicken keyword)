== Module (chicken keyword)

Keywords are written like symbols, but prefixed with {{#:}}.  They
evaluate to themselves. While they behave a lot like symbols in that
they are interned when read and can be compared in constant time with
{{eq?}}, they are a distinct type.  In particular, they have no plist,
they cannot be bound or assigned to and aren't {{eq?}} to a symbol
with the same spelling.  Procedures can use keywords to accept
optional named parameters in addition to normal required parameters.

The parameter {{keyword-style}} and the compiler/interpreter option
{{-keyword-style}} can be used to allow an additional keyword syntax,
either compatible to Common LISP, or to DSSSL.  As long as this
parameter is set to {{#:suffix}}, CHICKEN conforms to
[[http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-88/srfi-88.html|SRFI-88]].

There is also a {{srfi-88}} or {{(srfi 88)}} module which only
includes the standard procedures from the SRFI document, without the
CHICKEN extensions.  {{(chicken keyword)}} offers the complete set of
procedures, both CHICKEN-specific and standard SRFI-88.

==== get-keyword

<procedure>(get-keyword KEYWORD ARGLIST [THUNK])</procedure>

Returns the argument from {{ARGLIST}} specified under the keyword
{{KEYWORD}}. If the keyword is not found, then the zero-argument
procedure {{THUNK}} is invoked and the result value is returned. If
{{THUNK}} is not given, {{#f}} is returned.

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(define (increase x . args)
  (+ x (get-keyword #:amount args (lambda () 1))) )
(increase 123)                                      ==> 124
(increase 123 #:amount 10)                          ==> 133
</enscript>

Note: the {{KEYWORD}} may actually be any kind of object.


==== keyword?

<procedure>(keyword? X)</procedure>

Returns {{#t}} if {{X}} is a keyword, or {{#f}} otherwise.


==== keyword->string

<procedure>(keyword->string KEYWORD)</procedure>

Transforms {{KEYWORD}} into a string.


==== string->keyword

<procedure>(string->keyword STRING)</procedure>

Returns a keyword with the name {{STRING}}.
