== Bugs and limitations

* Compiling large files takes too much time.

* If a known procedure has unused arguments, but is always called without those parameters, then the optimizer ''repairs'' the procedure in certain situations and removes the parameter from the lambda-list.

* {{port-position}} currently works only for input ports.

* Leaf routine optimization can theoretically result in code that thrashes, if tight loops perform excessively many mutations. In practice this doesn't happen.

* Due to the header representation of block objects, the maximum size
of a bytevector-like object (strings, bytevectors, srfi-4 vectors etc) is
2^24 bytes or 16MiB.  On 64-bit machines the limit is less relevant,
at 2^56 bytes, or 65536 TiB (64 PiB).

* Like above, the maximum size of vector-like objects is 2^24 slots on
32 bit machines and 2^56 slots on 64-bit machines.

* Bignums are represented by bytevector objects instead of vector-like
objects due to the need to treat digits as opaque data.  This limits
bignums to a maximum value of 2^(2^27) on 32-bit machines and 2^(2^59)
on 64-bit machines.
