== Module (chicken random)

This module provides access to entropy (as provided by the operating
system) and a pseudo random number generator.

On UNIX systems entropy is by default obtained from {{/dev/urandom}}.
On Linux, the {{getrandom(2)}} system call is used instead, if available.
On OpenBSD it is {{arc4random_buf(3)}}, on Windows {{RtlGenRandom}}.

The pseudo random number generator is an implementation of the
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well_equidistributed_long-period_linear|WELL]] algorithm.

==== set-pseudo-random-seed!

<procedure>(set-pseudo-random-seed! SEED [SIZE])</procedure>

Set seed for the PRNG from the at most {{SIZE}} bytes of {{SEED}}.
which should be a byte vector or a string containing random data.
If {{SIZE}} is not given, it defaults to the size of {{SEED}}. If {{SIZE}}
(or the size of {{SEED}}) is below the required size of the random
state used by the PRNG, then it will necessarily be initialized in a less
random manner as possible.


==== pseudo-random-integer

<procedure>(pseudo-random-integer [RANGE])</procedure>

Returns a uniformly distributed pseudo random integer between 0 and 
{{RANGE-1}}, which may be a big integer.


==== pseudo-random-real

<procedure>(pseudo-random-real)</procedure>

Returns a uniformly distributed pseudo-random inexact number between
0 and 1.


==== random-bytes

<procedure>(random-bytes [BUF [SIZE]])</procedure>

Returns random bytes from the available entropy source. If {{BUF}} is
given, it should be a string or byte vector which will be filled with up to
{{SIZE}} random bytes. {{SIZE}} defaults to the size of the {{BUF}}
argument. If no arguments are given, {{random-bytes}} returns a
freshly allocated byte vector of sufficient size to be used as a seed
for {{set-pseudo-random-seed!}}.
