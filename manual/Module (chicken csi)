== Module (chicken csi)

This module provides procedures to access features specific to
the {{csi}} interactive interpreter.

=== toplevel-command

<procedure>(toplevel-command SYMBOL PROC [HELPSTRING])</procedure>

Defines or redefines a toplevel interpreter command which can be invoked by entering
{{,SYMBOL}}. {{PROC}} will be invoked when the command is entered and may
read any required argument via {{read}} (or {{read-line}}). If the optional
argument {{HELPSTRING}} is given, it will be listed by the {{,?}} command.


=== set-describer!

<procedure>(set-describer! TAG PROC)</procedure>

Sets a custom description handler that invokes {{PROC}} when the
{{,d}} command is invoked with a record-type object that has the type
{{TAG}} (a symbol). {{PROC}} is called with two arguments: the object
to be described and an output-port. It should write a possibly useful
textual description of the object to the passed output-port. For
example:

 #;1> (define-record-type point (make-point x y) point?
        (x point-x)
        (y point-y))
 #;2> (set-describer! 'point 
        (lambda (pt o)
          (with-output-to-port o
            (lambda ()
              (print "a point with x=" (point-x pt) " and y=" (point-y pt))))))
 #;3> ,d (make-point 1 2)
 a point with x=1 and y=2


=== default-evaluator

<procedure>(default-evaluator EXPR)</procedure>

Takes {{EXPR}} and processes any of the built-in toplevel commands provided
by {{csi}}. If {{EXPR}} is not a toplevel command, then it is evaluated using
{{eval}}. This procedure is intended to be passed as an argument to {{repl}}
to allow using {{csi}}s toplevel commands and history management in user-defined
read-eval-print loops.


=== editor-command

<parameter>editor-command</parameter>

Holds the name of an editor that should be used when the toplevel
command {{,e}} is used.
