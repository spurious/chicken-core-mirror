Deprecated functions and variables
==================================


5.0.0

- "bit->boolean" has been introduced temporarily to avoid users
  having to figure out why "bit-set?" uses a different argument
  order than the procedure with the same name that is specified in
  SRFI-33 and SRFI-60. This procedure will be replaced by the proper
  "bit-set?" in one of the next versions, together with a C level
  macro or function.

  "bit->boolean" expands into "C_u_i_bit_to_bool", "C_i_bit_to_bool"
  or "C_i_fixnum_bit_to_bool", which are all deprecated as well,
  but might be re-used in a future version of "bit-set?".
